   printf("Thanks for viewing my mural and going through the effort to compile this! Made with love by Brandon Lekai, an 8th grader in the graduating class of 2023. My locker was 653, if you have that locker then enjoy the many shelves I've left behind! Overall, I loved my time at Bedminster. I had such great teachers, such as Mrs. Mcfarland, Mrs. Hoffman, Mr. Oliveri, and more. I loved Mr. Copeland's sense of humor and sarcasm, learning syncopation and playing the glockenspiel was the best. Doing Wii Music with him is one of my most treasured memories at Bedminster. I loved learning the Alto Saxophone with the help of Mr. Lefurge; going to the Crimson Cafe with him was one of my favorite experiences, and doing the various concerts. I loved doing art with Mrs. Hershkowitz, no matter how bad I was at it, and doing Art Tech with Mrs. Burke, who was always happy to have a good laugh and a good time. Learning photoshop was an experience that I never thought I would get to have, but thanks to Mrs. Burke, it was a blast. Tech with Dr. Puglia was always fun, no matter if it was coding an app, or doing robotics with lego or vex. Mr. Notte, Mrs. Thomas, and Mr. Schantz always found a way to make gym class super fun. Games such as hector the protector, soccer elimination, and capture the flag were always the most fun to play. Ms. Cere was always there if I had a question in math (which was a lot of the time) and I honestly couldn't have asked for a better math teacher. Tech office with Mr. Pickett, Mr. Sneedse, and Gary were the best, and I have so many great memories of fixing computers and troubleshooting devices, not to mention having a great time with Cameron and Will who were there with me. I want to thank all my amazing teachers I had over the year, such as Mrs. Domanski, Mr. White, Mr. Johnson, Miss Mancini, Mrs. Gottshalk, Mrs. Godfrey, Mr. Biletski, Ms. Mitchell, and many more. You've all made my time at Bedminster the best, and I wouldn't choose any other school over this one. Eating lunch with my friends was one of the greatest times of the day. Me and my friends would discuss silly topics and make each other die of laughter. We also played various card games, such as exploding kittens with almost my whole lunch table and Magic: The Gathering with Carsten and Cameron. I have so many good memories of laughing with my fellow students and teachers. I'm very sad to have to leave this school, and I hope that someone will have as great of a time as me. I want to mention all my amazing friends in my friend group, Jake M., Mateo D., Will H., Carsten R., Cameron B., Jax G., Ben F., and Xavier P. I also want to mention my friends that moved away, such as Finn P., Daniel R., Arjun M., and Connor D. My other friends, Piper S., Zero/Luna R., Tristan D., Griffin A., and Ciara M. You guys made Bedminster so incredibly fun, and you guys were the best friends anyone could have ever asked for. Thank you Bedminster School, for all the friends, experiences and memories. Go Bulldogs! \n");
