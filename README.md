# 8th-grade-2023
So uhh... Tysm for going to this URL!! If you don't know github, it's used for sharing and downloading code or programs. Very helpful for developers. Ive left some files, and I'll leave some instructions to install, and a script for it too. You're encouraged to try to build this yourself, but if you can't I'll leave some binaries in https://github.com/waterdragon78/8th-grade-2023/releases. Look up instructions on how to run! Sorry Windows users, they're only available for macOS and Linux. Maybe I'll change that! I'm not sure. Feel free to look through the code, you may want to specifically look through mural.c. Aaaaaaand yea! That's about all. Have fun!

COMPILE INSTRUCTONS IF YOU DIDN'T SEE MY MURAL (How did you find this if you didn't???)!!

make sure you have git, gcc, and make on your computer. Google how to install if you don't or don't know. If you TRUELY can't compile, download a prebuild binary from https://github.com/waterdragon78/8th-grade-2023/releases.
(to run press enter)
1. open terminal
2. run "git clone https://github.com/waterdragon78/8th-grade-2023" WITHOUT PARENTHESES
3. run "cd 8th-grade-2023" WITHOUT PARENTHESES
4. run "chmod +x configure" WITHOUT PARENTHESES
5. run "./configure && make" WITHOUT PARENTHESES
5a. NOTE: if you get an error that says something like "config.status: error: Something went wrong bootstrapping makefile fragments for automatic dependency tracking." run this instead, "./configure --disable-dependency-tracking && make". If this fails, you probably don't have a dependancy which you may have to install manually.
5b. NOTE: if you get an error that something isn't installed, google how to install it
6. run "./BLmural2023" WITHOUT PARENTHESES
7. Read!

LAZY METHOD (GO COMPILE U LAZY PERSON)

1. open terminal
2. run "git clone https://github.com/waterdragon78/8th-grade-2023" WITHOUT PARENTHESES
3. run "cd 8th-grade-2023" WITHOUT PARENTHESES
4. run "chmod +x LazyMethod.sh" WITHOUT PARENTHESES
5. run "./LazyMethod.sh" WITHOUT PARENTHESES

(seriously tho, the whole point is to compile u lazy person, go do that)
